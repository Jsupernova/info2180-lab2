		 <article>To shop from conventional retail stores, you need to travel and need to take time off your work.

Shopping online is a great way to save time and money. You won't have to drive to the mall.<p>
		 Shopping online is considered fairly low-risk. According to CNN, "The prevalent opinion is that online credit card use is actually no riskier for consumers than traditional 'low-tech' transactions.".You should feel as safe as you would using a credit card in a store or restaurant, if not more so.</p></article>
